This place is for some notes and progress tracking for myself :-)
This multi-solution inverse kinematics problem is solved using a bunch of helper functions

Basic conversion functions are used to convert between the different coordinate systems like
conversion from arc parameters to quaternion and etc. This includes the following functions which can 
be found in conversionHelper.cpp:
    - arc2q.m  (implemented)
    - q2arc.m  (implemented)
    - arc2xi.m
        - This one is also simply following the MATLAB code.
        No specific eigen functions are used here except for the usual
        MatrixXd and VectorXd and etc.
    - xi2arc.m  (implemented)
    - xi2len.m  
        - This one is not implemented yet but most of this function is very similar to 
          the MATLAB code. There are some eigen specific functions that need to be used like
          matrix.zeros() and transpose and etc.
    - q2rot.m  (implemented)
    - rot2q.m (implemented)

There are also some numerical methods that are used to solve the inverse kinematics problem.
The main two functions will be implemented in NumericalMethods.cpp:
    - revise_newton.m
        - This function also seems pretty straightforward. Although, they did use some build-in MATLAB functions
            which might be needed to be implemented in C++ using eigen.
                - NaN(M,N) produces an M-by-N matrix of NaN values. The alternative to this
                in eigen is to simply use a matrix with zeros.
                - norm(X) is also which where an exact equivalent is available in eigen.
                - Jacobian helper function is also used.
